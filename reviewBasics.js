// # Review 1 - basics

// NOTE! Pay close attention to creating code with good and consistent code style.

// 1. Make a variable and assign an even number to that variable. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const evenNumber = 16; //This variable cannot be changed since it is declared with const

// 2. Make a variable and assign a negative odd number to that variable. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.
const negativeNumber = -3;

// 3. Make a variable and assign a string to that variable using double quotes. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const stringDoubleQuote = "Hello World"
// 4. Make a variable and assign a string to that variable using single quotes. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

stringSingleQuote = 'Hello World'

// 5. Make a variable and assign a string to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable cannot be changed.

const templateLiteral = `The people in the delivery room were shocked when the newborn shouted ${stringDoubleQuote}!`
// 6. Make a variable and assign an empty string to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable *can* be changed.
let emptyString = `" "` // 'let' permits changes to be made to the variable

// 7. Make a variable and assign a boolean to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable *can* be changed.
let booleanVariable // wrongly worded question, I think

// 8. Make a variable and assign a boolean to that variable using a template literal. Make sure that variable can not be changed.

// ## This question seems wrongly worded too ##


// 9. Print the `type` of a variable that has a number value.
console.log( typeof evenNumber)
// 10. Print the `type` of a variable that has a string value.
console.log( typeof stringDoubleQuote)

// 11. Print the `type` of a variable that has a boolean value.
let thisVariable = true
console.log( typeof thisVariable)
